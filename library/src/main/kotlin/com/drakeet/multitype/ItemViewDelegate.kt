   * the View can be recycled. Keep in mind that the View in question is already removed from
   * the RecyclerView.
   *
   * In some cases, it is acceptable to recycle a View although it has transient state. Most
   * of the time, this is a case where the transient state will be cleared in
   * [.onBindViewHolder] call when View is rebound to a new item.
   * For this reason, RecyclerView leaves the decision to the Adapter and uses the return
   * value of this method to decide whether the View should be recycled or not.
   *
   * Note that when all animations are created by [RecyclerView.ItemAnimator], you
   * should never receive this callback because RecyclerView keeps those Views as children
   * until their animations are complete. This callback is useful when children of the item
   * views create animations which may not be easy to implement using an [ ].
   *
   * You should *never* fix this issue by calling

   * `holder.itemView.setHasTransientState(true);`. Each
   * `View.setHasTransientState(true)` call must be matched by a
   * `View.setHasTransientState(false)` call, otherwise, the state of the View
   * may become inconsistent. You should always prefer to end or cancel animations that are
   * triggering the transient state instead of handling it manually.

   * transient state.
   * @return True if the View should be recycled, false otherwise. Note that if this method
   * returns `true`, RecyclerView *will ignore* the transient state of
   * the View and recycle it regardless. If this method returns `false`,
   * RecyclerView will check the View's transient state again before giving a final decision.
