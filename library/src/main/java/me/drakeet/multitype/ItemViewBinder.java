     * the View can be recycled. Keep in mind that the View in question is already removed from
     * the RecyclerView.
     * <p>
     * In some cases, it is acceptable to recycle a View although it has transient state. Most
     * of the time, this is a case where the transient state will be cleared in
     * {@link #onBindViewHolder(ViewHolder, Object)} call when View is rebound to a new item.
     * For this reason, RecyclerView leaves the decision to the Adapter and uses the return
     * value of this method to decide whether the View should be recycled or not.
     * <p>
     * Note that when all animations are created by {@link RecyclerView.ItemAnimator}, you
     * should never receive this callback because RecyclerView keeps those Views as children
     * until their animations are complete. This callback is useful when children of the item
     * views create animations which may not be easy to implement using an {@link

     * <code>View.setHasTransientState(true)</code> call must be matched by a
     * <code>View.setHasTransientState(false)</code> call, otherwise, the state of the View
     * may become inconsistent. You should always prefer to end or cancel animations that are
     * triggering the transient state instead of handling it manually.
     *
     * @param holder The ViewHolder containing the View that could not be recycled due to its
     * transient state.
     * @return True if the View should be recycled, false otherwise. Note that if this method
     * returns <code>true</code>, RecyclerView <em>will ignore</em> the transient state of
     * the View and recycle it regardless. If this method returns <code>false</code>,
     * RecyclerView will check the View's transient state again before giving a final decision.
